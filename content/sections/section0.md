# Yurt | Camp

UPDATE! --- Yurt|Camp is on the move! This season our goat herd and our yurt|camp collective is transitioning bio-regions! While we are excited for this adventure, but unfortunately we need to put our services on pause for now. But don't worry, we will be back this winter to take [new yurt pre-orders!](mailto:orders@yurt.camp) We will continue our production out west as soon as possible. [Send us a message letting us know if you would like to be added to our mailing list.](mailto:news@yurt.camp) Thanks!
