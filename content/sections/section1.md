## Why a Yurt?

A yurt is an affordable, beautiful, low impact and environmentally conscious mobile dwelling. More cost-effective than a tiny house for travelers, it is also more elegant and beautiful for those looking for a sedentary retreat to escape and live more closely to nature. We can help you find what you need. Email us for a free consultation and affordable contracting for anything Yurts. You can check out our other services @ [goat.camp](https://goat.camp/). Hope to hear from you!
